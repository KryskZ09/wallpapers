# Kry's Wallpaper Storage
GitHub can basically store anything, so why not my wallpapers as well?
Wallpapers are described like this: `<source>_<id>-<width>x<height>`  

* Source:
    * Can be any source, such as wallhaven.cc
* ID:
    * Anything that would identify them on the source, such as wallhaven.cc/w/id
* Width & Height:
    * The resolution, usually this is going to be 1920x1080
